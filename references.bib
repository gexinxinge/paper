   Abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many Large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of Large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems},

However, one of the most fundamental problems has not yet been well addressed: predicting the evolution of spreading based on a given snapshot of the propagation on networks. With this problem solved, one can accelerate or slow down the spreading in advance if the predicted propagation result is narrower or wider than expected. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to estimate the infection probability of the spreading process and then apply it to a mean-field approach to predict the spreading coverage. The validation of the method is performed in both artificial and real networks. The results show that our method is accurate in both infection probability estimation and spreading coverage prediction.},

   Abstract = {Ascertaining the existence of hidden objects in a complex system, objects that cannot be observed from the external world, not only is curiosity-driven but also has significant practical applications. Generally, uncovering a hidden node in a  complex network requires successful identification of its neighboring nodes, but  a challenge is to differentiate its effects from those of noise. We develop a completely data-driven, compressive-sensing based method to address this issue by utilizing complex weighted networks with continuous-time oscillatory or discrete-time evolutionary-game dynamics. For any node, compressive sensing enables accurate reconstruction of the dynamical equations and coupling functions, provided that time series from this node and all its neighbors are available. For a neighboring node of the hidden node, this condition cannot be met, resulting in abnormally large prediction errors that, counterintuitively, can be used to infer the existence of the hidden node. Based on the principle of  differential signal, we demonstrate that, when strong noise is present, insofar as at least two neighboring nodes of the hidden node are subject to weak background noise only, unequivocal identification of the hidden node can be achieved.},

Our method, which is based on the belief propagation algorithm, is efficient, naturally distributed, and exact on trees. As a particular case, we consider the problem of finding the  "zero patient" of a susceptible-infected-recovered or susceptible-infected epidemic given a snapshot of the state of the network at a later unknown time. Numerical simulations show that our method outperforms previous ones on both synthetic and real networks, often by a very large margin.},

However the threshold is higher in the rewiring case.

   Volume = {PP},
   Number = {99},
   Pages = {1-1},
   Abstract = {This paper studies the problem of detecting the information source in a network in which the spread of information follows the popular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially, except one single information source that is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know the graph topology and all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample-path-based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for <formula formulatype="inline"><tex Notation="TeX">$g+1$</tex> </formula>-regular trees such that <formula formulatype="inline"><tex Notation="TeX">$gq>1$</tex> </formula>, where <formula formulatype="inline"><tex Notation="TeX">$g+1$</tex> </formula> is the node degree and <formula formulatype="inline"><tex Notation="TeX">$q$</tex> </formula> is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with a high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic. We then further evaluate the performance of the reverse infection algorithm on several real-world networks.},

This estimator is based upon a novel topological quantity which we term rumor centrality. We establish that this is a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for a class of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has nontrivial detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power grid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within a few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding rumor sources in networks which are not tree-like.},

Despite recent progress in this area, reconstructing networks with stochastic dynamical processes from limited time series remains to be an outstanding problem. Here we develop a framework based on compressed sensing to reconstruct complex networks on which stochastic spreading dynamics take place. We apply the methodology to a large number of model and real networks, finding that a full reconstruction of inhomogeneous interactions can be achieved from small amounts of polarized (binary) data, a virtue of compressed sensing. Further, we demonstrate that a hidden source that triggers the spreading process but is externally inaccessible can be ascertained and located with high confidence in the absence of direct routes of propagation from it. Our approach thus establishes a paradigm for tracing and controlling epidemic invasion and information diffusion in complex networked systems.},

When there are more than two infection sources, we present heuristics that have quadratic complexity. We show through simulations that our proposed estimators can correctly identify the infection sources to within a few hops with high probability.},

   Abstract = {Given a snapshot of a large graph, in which an infection has been spreading for some time, can we identify those nodes from which the infection started to spread? In other words, can we reliably tell who the culprits are? In this paper we answer this question affirmatively, and give an efficient method called NETSLEUTH for the well-known Susceptible-Infected virus propagation model. Essentially, we are after that set of seed nodes that best explain the given snapshot. We propose to employ the Minimum Description Length principle to identify the best set of seed nodes and virus propagation ripple, as the one by which we can most succinctly describe the infected graph. We give an highly efficient algorithm to identify likely sets of seed nodes given a snapshot. Then, given these seed nodes, we show we can optimize the virus propagation ripple in a principled way by maximizing likelihood. With all three combined, NETSLEUTH can automatically identify the correct number of seed nodes, as well as which nodes are the culprits. Experimentation on our method shows high accuracy in the detection of seed nodes, in addition to the correct automatic identification of their number. Moreover, we show NETSLEUTH scales linearly in the number of nodes of the graph.},

We assume that a piece of information spreads in a network following a heterogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, where a node is said to be <i>infected</i> when it receives the information and <i>recovered</i> when it removes or hides the information. We further assume that a small subset of infected nodes are reported, from which we need to find the source of the information. We adopt the sample path based estimator developed in [1], and prove that on infinite trees, the sample path based estimator is a Jordan infection center with respect to the set of observed infected nodes. In other words, the sample path based estimator minimizes the maximum distance to observed infected nodes. We further prove that the distance between the estimator and the actual source is upper bounded by a constant independent of the number of infected nodes with a high probability on infinite trees. Our simulations on tree networks and real world networks show that the sample path based estimator is closer to the actual source than several other algorithms.},

   Abstract = {
Epidemic models on networks have long been studied by biologists and social sciences to determine the steady state levels of an infection on a network. Recently, however, several authors have begun considering the more difficult problem of estimating the source of an infection given information about its behavior some time after the initial infection. In this paper, we describe a technique to estimate the source of an infection on a general graph based on observations from a small set of observers during a fixed time window at some unknown time after the initial infection. We describe an alternate representation for the susceptible-infected (SI) infection model based on geodesic distances on a randomly-weighted version of the graph; this representation allows us to exploit fast algorithms to compute geodesic distances to estimate the marginal distributions for each observer and compute a pseudo-likelihood function that is maximized to find the source.},

   Abstract = {Information that propagates through social networks can carry a lot of false claims. For example, rumors on certain topics can propagate rapidly leading to a large number of nodes reporting the same (incorrect) observations. In this paper, we describe an approach for nding the rumor source and assessing the likelihood that a piece of information is in fact a rumor, in the absence of data provenance information. We model the social network as a directed graph, where vertices represent individuals and directed edges represent information  ow (e.g., who follows whom on Twitter). A number of monitor nodes are injected into the network whose job is to report data they receive. Our algorithm identies rumors and their sources by observing which of the monitors received the given piece of information and which did not. We show that, with a sucient number of monitor nodes, it is possible to recognize most rumors and their sources with high accuracy.},

   Abstract = {The history of infections and epidemics holds famous examples where understanding, containing and ultimately treating an outbreak began with understanding its mode of spread. The key question then, is: which network of interactions is the main cause of the spread? And can we determine the causative network without any knowledge of the epidemic, other than the identify of a minuscule subsample of infected nodes? This comes down to understanding the diagnostic power of network information. Specifically, in this paper we consider an epidemic that spreads on one of two networks. At some point in time, we see a small random subsample (perhaps a vanishingly small fraction) of those infected. We derive sufficient conditions two networks must have for this problem to be identifiable. We provide an efficient algorithm that solves the hypothesis testing problem on such graphs, and we characterize a regime in which our algorithm succeeds. Finally, we show that the condition we need for this identifiability property is fairly mild, and in particular, is satisfied by two common graph topologies: the grid, and the Erdo&#x0308;s-Renyi graphs.},

Optimal estimators were recently proposed for regular (exponential growth) and irregular geometric (polynomial growth) trees when all nodes that heard the rumor reveal themselves. We provide the extension to the case in which nodes reveal whether they have heard the rumor with probability p, independent of each other. For geometric trees and p &gt; 0, we achieve the same performance as the optimal estimator with p = 1.

   Abstract = {Suppose that a rumor originating from a single source among a set of suspects spreads in a network, how to root out this rumor source? With the a priori knowledge of suspect nodes and a snapshot observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the susceptible-infected (SI) model. We propose to use a notion of local rumor center to characterize P<sub>c</sub>(n), the correct detection probability of the source estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and asymptotic regimes, for regular trees of node degree &#x03B4;. First, when all nodes are suspects, lim<sub>n&#x2192;&#x221E;</sub>P<sub>c</sub>(n) grows from 0.25 to 0.307 as &#x03B4; increases from three to infinity, a result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a different approach; furthermore, P<sub>c</sub>(n) monotonically decreases with n and increases with &#x03B4; even in the finite-n regime. Second, when the suspect nodes form a connected subgraph of the network, lim<sub>n&#x2192;&#x221E;</sub>P<sub>c</sub>(n) significantly exceeds the a priori probability if &#x03B4; &#x2265; 3, and reliable detection is achieved as &#x03B4; becomes sufficiently large; furthermore, P<sub>c</sub>(n) monotonically decreases with n and increases with &#x03B4;. Third, when there are only two suspect nodes, lim<sub>n&#x2192;&#x221E;</sub>P<sub>c</sub>(n) is at least 0.75 if &#x03B4; &#x2265; 3; and P<sub>c</sub>(n) increases with the distance between the two suspects. Fourth, when there are multiple suspect nodes, among all possible connection patterns, that all the suspects form a single connected subgraph yields the smallest P<sub>c</sub>(n). Our analysis leverages ideas from the Po&#x0301;lya's urn model in probability theory and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process not only in the asymptotic regime but also for the general finite-n regime.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},
