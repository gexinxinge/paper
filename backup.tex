In general, the equilibrium (or the stationary state) is reached when the average
of the cooperation level becomes time-independent.
For $\rho_C^0$ we consider the following thirteen choices $\rho_C^0$ = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9.
Note that our scale for smaller $\rho_C^0$ is exponential, while it is linear for
larger $\rho_C^0$, in order to better examine the extreme conditions where
cooperation is expected to be promoted.
