\section{Introduction}

In the process of evolving human species, cooperation plays a
crucial role \cite{hammerstein2003genetic,hofbauer1998evolutionary}.
Human life is inconceivable without high level cooperation.
In the context of widely known Darwinian evolution, selfish individuals pursue
their optimum when interact with others, rather than altruistic cooperation.
Therefore how the large-scale cooperation emerges, sustains and evolves has become a
challenging subject for many different fields from biology,economic to social sciences.
    Evolutionary game theory\cite{smith1982evolution,nowakevolutionary} provides a convenient
and fundamental framework for the elucidation of this domain
\cite{Trivers-18254,RapoportChammah-18253,FundenbergMaskin-18255,KendallYao-18256}.
It has been proven to be one of the most fruitful approachers to investigate behavioral problems and successfully applied in various fields such as evolutionary biology and psychology,
computer science, political science and military strategy, sociology,
ethics and moral philosophy, and economics\cite{NowakSigmund-18283,PoncelaGómez-Gardeñes-18278,Tanimoto-18277,
ImhofFudenberg-18279,SantosPacheco-18280,Gracia-LázaroCuesta-18281,AntonioniTomassini-18282,
TanimotoBrede-18276}.
    One of seminal works is performed by Nowak \cite{Nowak-18317}who summarized five kinds of supportive mechanisms 
that could unravel the emergence of cooperation, including kin selection, direct reciprocity,
indirect reciprocity, spatial reciprocities and group selection.
Among them, direct and spatial reciprocity or referred as network reciprocity have perhaps been the
most widely studied.
Accordingly, the network reciprocity particularly  becomes a potent tool to characterize the evolution
among real-world systems \cite{boccaletti2006complex}.

%%%% literature and problem
    More recently, compelling evidence has been accumulated that a plethora of biological,
social, and technological real-world networks of contacts are mostly
heterogeneous \cite{AmaralScala-18284,DorogovtsevMendes-18285,AlbertBarabási-18286}.
Previous works on the influence of network reciprocity yield one general conclusion that
increasing heterogeneity favors the emergence of cooperation which has been corroborated
by many researchers\cite{SantosPacheco-18280}.
   Among various factors reflecting heterogeneous characteristics of populations,
most studies have focused on heterogenous structure in terms of vertex degree such as
allocating payoffs proportional degree\cite{SantosSantos-18293},
which implies that the disparity between population is evaluated by the number of connections to neighborhood.
However, the networks with identical degree distribution perhaps
exhibit great difference in regarding of individual importance.
In the perspective of spreading and propagation, more importantly, the strategies can be diffused among
individuals as well as epidemic and information and a variety of measures have been proven to outperform
degree centrality as for example k-core, betweenness xx.
Then, an natural question is: To which extent the different individual centralities affect evolutionary behavior?
    Besides this, previous research has discerning the effect of degree distribution based on multiple indicators
 such as frequently used single-free, scale-free, and broad-scale xx.
Due to the sensitivity and dependance xx , we are interested whether the identical degree distribution yield the same cooperation level.
    In short, investigate the effect of centrality is important,
as a better understanding would allow controlling the evolutionary dynamic,
which for the scope of this paper, means exploring which individuals are
more closely related to cooperative behaviors.
Thus further investigations would be required to clarify the distinguished role of centralities
in populations with different density of connection.

%%%% our work
To achieve a comprehensive insight of this issue, we have performed a systematic computational
study, taking into account seven most representative metrics of individual importance on
prototypical model for heterogenous structure of population.
we extend heterogeneity from degree to individual importance based on various centralities.
We cooperate these centralities into evolutionary game via two approaches.
First, initial cooperation strategies of each players are preferentially assigned instead of random assignment.
Second, players updating rules not only compare their own payoffs but also their centralities.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Model}

\label{network model}
The structured heterogeneous populations can be modeled through mapping players to
nodes of heterogeneous network.
According to the strength of heterogeneity,the widely used models include two types,
(i)moderately heterogeneous single-scale which are characterized by degree distributions that exhibit a fast,typically Gaussian, decaying tail\cite{AmaralScala-18327};
(ii)strongly heterogeneous scale-free which are characterized by a distribution that decays as a power-law. The Baraba´si–Albert(BA) model provides the best known model leading to overall scale-free degree distributions,$d(k)\approx k^{-\gamma}$.
Besides strength of heterogeneity, another crucial difference between these two models is that BA model
doesn't contains node of $k=1$. In fact, the lest degree is determined by the number of edges that should be attached from the new vertex to pre-existing vertices at each time step, which leads to all the vertices have identical coreness. In other words, Coreness centrality can not discern individuals in BA networks. As discussed in the next section, Coreness is one critical metric to measure the influence of individual, which has attracted intensive attention and has been as a baseline in the comparison of different centralities.
In addition, in BA model the max-degree increases with the size of network whereas the range of degree is relatively constant in xx model.
In Fig.\ref{fig_degree},we show degree distribution of networks with different average degree. To compare BA model and xx model, we give the fitting curves based on $d(k)\approx k^{-\gamma}$ function. Note that a power function is not the best option for exactly fitting given degree distribution from xx model, as our primary purpose is to observe the discrepancy between single-free and scale-free.
It can be seen that compared with degree distribution of BA model which strictly follows power-law, xx model contains less lower degree vertices which becomes apparent with the increase of $<k>$.
In terms of xx model, heterogeneity proportionally related with degree $k$, namely the more average connectivity, the stronger heterogeneity. As shown in Fig\ref{fig_degree}, the power law exponent increases from  $\gamma=-2.6$ to $\gamma=-1.8$ with the average degree changes from $k=8$ to $k=2$.
Therefor, we can use networks with different average degrees distinguish the affect of strength of heterogeneity
Note that, xx model definitely produces disconnected network with small $k$, below which there are not
enough links to connect all the vertices, which perhaps leads to xx.
In this case, we only make use of the largest partition as population structure.
To avoid stochastic effect, we have checked larger network size up to $N=10^5$ and smaller one,
down to values of $N=100$.
We found that populations size $N>1500$ is able to remain results unchanged so that in the present study,
we performed simulations for the setup of network size $N=2000$ and $k=2,4,6,8$.

  \caption{Degree distribution of power law networks of $k=2,4,6,8$.

  \label{fig_degree}
\end{figure}


\label{centrality,option, corr}
In some contexts, an accurate mathematical
definition for a critical node, particularly for highly complex systems such as the
brain [7], may not yet exist.

As mentioned above, centrality metrics quantify vertex importance in a network based on varying mechanisms.
Here we first review the representative centrality metrics widely used.
\begin{itemize}

\item Degree(Deg)

Degree is the simplest and the most straightforward indicator to measure the importance
of certain individuals, that is, to count the number of vertices who have connected with it.
The presence of few highly connected hubs is the most prominent feature in terms of heterogeneity.
The vertices with the highest degree in the network usually are referred as hubs who
can influence more nodes effectively due to having the greatest number of neighbors.
Degree has been reported indeed play a crucial role in evolutionary games as well as in epidemic and propagation field.
For instance, players with a high degree possess evolutionary advantage due to the larger
number of games they play.
Therefore in the present work, degree is seen as a fundamental metric in PD game.

\item Coreness(Cor)

Recently, Kitsaket al. \cite{KitsakGallos-17826} argued that the location of a node is
more significant than the number of its linked neighbours, and
they suggested that coreness is a better indicator of a vertex’s
influence on spreading dynamics than degree.
For example, if a hub exists at the end of a branch
at the periphery of a network, it will have a minimal impact
in the spreading process through the core of the network,
whereas a less connected person who is strategically placed in
the core of the network will have a significant effect that leads
to dissemination through a large fraction of the population.
The coreness of a vertex is measured by k-core decomposition \cite{DorogovtsevGoltsev-18309} ,
and a larger coreness value indicates that the vertex is more centrally located in
the network, which implies the topological position of individuals in population perhaps affects evolutionary outcome.

\item H-index(Hid)

The Hirsch index (also called the H-index)\cite{Hirsch-18310} was originally used
to measure the citation impact of a scholar or a journal \cite{BraunGlänzel-18314}.
For a scholar or journal, the H-index is defined as the maximum value such
that there exists at least h papers, each with citation count.
Recently, Lü, L., et al.\cite{LüZhou-18192} discovered that degree, H-index and coreness are the initial, intermediate and steady states of the sequences, respectively;
and the H-index is a good tradeoff that in many cases can better quantify vertex influence than either degree or coreness.

\item Betweenness(Bet)
Betweenness \cite{Anthonisse-18331} is one of the most popular geodesic-path-based ranking measures,
which is defined as the fraction of shortest paths between all node pairs that
pass through the node of interest.
L. Freeman \cite{Freeman-18315} has introduced the expression below to compute this centrality,

\item Closeness(Clo)
Assigns scores to each vertex based on the mean distance to each other vertex.
The closeness \cite{KoschützkiLehmann-18332} of a node i is the average hopcount
of the shortest paths from nodei to all other nodes. It
measures how close a node is to all the others. The most
commonly used definition is the reciprocal of the total
hopcount

Thus, the more central a node is the lower its total distance from all other nodes.

\item Clustering(Clu)

Clustering Coefficient(CC) was proposed by Duncan J. Watts and Steven Strogatz \cite{WattsStrogatz-18333} in order to determine whether a graph is a small-world network.
For a vertex i, the local clustering coefficient C is the fraction of actual links within its neighborhood to the number of potential links that could possibly exist among them.
In a different context the clustering coefficient characterizes the proportion between the number of observed triangles to all possible triangles as link transitivity in one network, quantifying how close its neighbors are to being a clique (complete graph).
In many cases the presence of clustering structure in the network seems to be the crucial feature responsible for favoring cooperators or defectors\cite{SantosPacheco-18280,Gracia-LázaroCuesta-18325,HuangZheng-18221}.
In the context of evolutionary dynamic, it is reasonable to quantify the influence of a vertex through its clustering coefficient.
Note that CC takes smaller values for more central nodes, in opposite to the other centrality measures.

\item Eigenvector(Eig)

Besides aforementioned metrics, we also consider another frequently used metric eigenvector centrality,
for a vertex which is defined as the fraction of time that a random walk(er) will spend at that vertex
over an infinite time horizon.
Formally, it is defined by the eigenvector associated to the largest eigenvalue
of the adjacency matrix A of network.
Its variant, Google's PageRank based on the concept that connections to high-scoring sites contribute
more to the score of the site in question than equal connections to low-scoring sites, is more well-known.

\end{itemize}


In order to explorer for this study the influences on the evolutionary outcome
caused by individual importance, we systematically analyzed the properties of aforementioned
centralities, including the distribution of centrality score and correlation.
Although the correlations between centrality metrics have been studied\cite{LiLi-18181,šikićLančić-17843},
the ranked sequence of vertices heavily depends on the dynamical regime and the topological features of network.
It is necessary to investigate the correlation between any two centrality metrics on
the networks used in the present study.
As detailed in Fig.\ref{fig corr centrality k=2} and \ref{fig corr centrality k=8}, we computed the Pearson correlation coefficients
between any two centrality metrics.

  The diagonal insets depict density estimation of centralities.
  The Pearson Correlation Coefficients of any two centrality metrics are shown on upper triangular insets.
  Note that the centrality Eigenvector and Degree indicates a perfect positive correlation.
  It also should be noted that centrality Clustering is negatively correlated with all the other centralities.

  \label{fig corr centrality k=8}
\end{figure}

\label{game model}
    The evolutionary dynamic is defined as follow.
Two players(individuals) interact with each other through strategies of Cooperation(C) and Defection(D).
They both get a reward $R$ for mutual cooperation and a punishment $P$ for mutual defection.
If one player cooperates while the other defects, their game payoffs are $S$
(sucker's payoff) and $T$ (temptation), respectively.
Strategists accumulate their payoffs through playing with their own neighbors and the payoff
to a player is in terms of the effect on its fitness.
In the PD game, the ordering of the four payoffs is $T > R > P > S$ , which immediately follows
that the optimum choice for both players is defection regardless of opponent's strategy.
But $2R > T+S$ indicates that mutual cooperation will get higher cumulative income.
Thus, there is a dilemma.
    In homogeneous and infinite populations, the individual's selfish and non-cooperative behavior
with short-term benefit will prevail under replicate dynamics  without any specific mechanism.
Obviously this is an unfavorable scenario in the perspective of social progress.
\label{sovle dilemma}Over the past few decades,therefore researchers have proposed various
approaches or mechanisms to solve this dilemma.
Different from traditional practice, here we set $R=2$ and $P=1$ and
correspondingly $0\leq S \leq1$ and $2\leq S \leq3$.
The studied region in the T-S plane we employed was sampled in steps of 0.1,
thus encompassing $11 \times 11=121$ parameter combinations.

    We simulate the evolutionary process with synchronous update procedure comprising
discrete elementary steps(game round) where the whole population play simultaneously.
Initially, a portion of individuals $\rho_{c}(0)$ randomly chosen are assigned cooperation strategy and others defection strategy.
Each round consists of two basic stages.
First, all the individuals in the population play the game once with all their neighbors and obtain
corresponding payoffs according to payoff matrix.
Second, they all update their strategy at once and their payoff is reset to zero before the next
game round.
With strategy updating, we adopted \textit{Fermi rule}\cite{SzabóTőke-18257}.
Player $x$ with strategy $s_x$ imitates the strategy $s_y$ of another player $y$,
chosen randomly from $x’s$ neighborhood, iff $y’s$ strategy has yielded higher payoff,
otherwise player $x$ maintains its original strategy.
Player $x$ takes over the strategy $s_y$  with a probability determined by
the Fermi function

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(s_y^t\rightarrow s_x^{t+1})=\frac{1}{1+e^{-[(P_y^t-P_x^t)]/k}}
\end{equation}
where $k=0.1$ quantifies the uncertainty related to the strategy changing process.
The selected value of $k$ is a traditional and frequently employed choice that does
not qualitatively affect the evolutionary outcomes, as shown in many preceding
works and reviewed comprehensively in \cite{szabo2007evolutionary,wang2014degree}.
In our works, above setups including random initialization of strategy, imitator update rule and parameters
related to PD game xx standard imitator dynamics.

we have found that, for population sizes $N=2000$, times well over 5000 steps
warrants a correct convergence and steady outcome, in agreement with many other works in field, like for example xx.
If the population did not reach full cooperation or defection,
an average of the cooperation density during the last tenth of the evolution was used to obtain
the asymptotic cooperation density which is indicated by $\rho_{c}(\infty)$.
In order to measure the cooperation level under payoffs matrix, we use a quantitative measure  $\mathcal{C}$
for the overall asymptotic cooperation in game G, given by averaging the $\rho_{c}(\infty)$
over the corresponding region in the ST -plane.
Moreover, to assure suitable accuracy and avoid the stochastic effect all the final results are obtained
via averaging 100 independent runs for each set of parameters.

\section{ Results and discussion}

\subsection{Centrality preferential cooperators}

    The presentation of the results begins with the standard imitator dynamics
on a series of xx population(see Section xx) which would be seen as benchmark for the following further results.
Fig.\ref{powerlawK2468TSPanel} illustrates the impact of average degree $k$ and initial proportion of cooperators
 $\rho_{c}(0)$ on the outcome of the T-S space panel.
In the first place, it is clearly evidenced that heterogeneity boosts cooperation as verified in a lot of works xx.
Although there are arguments in experiments on this point as for example Carlos Gracia-Lázaro, etl argue that heterogeneous networks do not promote cooperation when humans play a Prisoner’s Dilemma
\cite{Gracia-LázaroFerrer-18206}
, we can confirm this conclusion under the present conditions.
Second, the stable cooperation level depends on the initial condition, which was underestimated in previous works.
The area of full cooperation in the T-S panel is extended With the increase of $\rho_{c}(0)$.
And finally, it is suggested that with the average degree increases the networks approximates more and more closely
to the well-mixed structure, which has been proved to be inhibitor toward cooperators.
Consequently,the populations of larger <k> would lead to the lower cooperation level.
However, it can be observed that the influence of <K> is not monotonous toward cooperation level,
k=2 being the exception from k=4,6,8.
Therefore, we further inspect the conditions of smaller resolution of <k> and the result is given
 in Fig.\ref{powerlawK23TSPanel}.
we observe from Fig.\ref{powerlawK2468TSPanel} and Fig.\ref{powerlawK23TSPanel}
that irrespective of initial fraction of cooperators the mean $\rho_{c}(\infty)$ on T-S panel reaches the maximum
at k=2.7
In other words, the cooperation level does not monotonously depend on the average degree of underlying network.
This implies there exist an intermediate connection density optimally sustaining cooperation.
Another remarkable results xx, coexist, frozen, full cooperation
substantial connection.

The presented results indicate that the evolution of cooperation is affected by initial condition and degree.
Note the non-monotonicity of the results dependent on degree $k$.}

This result evidences cooperation can be optimally promoted in the degree between 2.5 and 3.0.}
\label{powerlawK23TSPanel}
\end{figure}

%%% top rank cooperator
    In what concerns the initial conditions, the above results based on the assumption
that each player randomly adopt cooperate or defect strategy before game proceeding,
which is one of default conditions in many previous research.
Nevertheless, complete randomness does not consist with real-world conditions
because individuals usually have certain preferences and consider comprehensive factors
when take action in evolutionary dynamic.
In our simulations, all the players are ranked according to centrality i then top faction $f_c$
are chosen as cooperators.
We discuss this setup for two main reasons. 1); 2) ;

    We computed the cooperation level in simulation with above setups and parameters and
the results for k=2,2.7,4,8 are depicted separately in Figs.\ref{PowerlawK2TopRankTSPanel}, \ref{PowerlawK2.7TopRankTSPanel},
\ref{PowerlawK4TopRankTSPanel}, and \ref{PowerlawK8TopRankTSPanel}.
Notably, we assessed the conditions where k=2-3 at interval 0.1 and k=3-8 at interval 1,
while only list the representative xx results corresponding to the benchmark simulations shown in
Figs. \ref{powerlawK2468TSPanel}and \ref{powerlawK23TSPanel}.
    On the whole, preferential initialization significantly promotes cooperation in the region of T-S space
compared with random initialization.
More importantly, this happens irrespectively of the values of initial fraction of cooperators and, more importantly,
of the degree $<k>$.
All the centralities give more or less boost for cooperation and
as predicted in the xx the sole exception that deviates others is clustering.
    Fig.\ref{PowerlawK2TopRankTSPanel} displays the simulation result in sparse network k=2,
corresponding to the first row in Fig.\ref{powerlawK2468TSPanel}.
To compare the effect of different centralities, we ranked centralities according to $\mathcal{C}$
and sensitivity to $\rho_{C}(0)$ as following

\begin{eqnarray*}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{C}_{Deg}>\mathcal{C}_{Bet}>\mathcal{C}_{HIn}>\mathcal{C}_{Clo}>\mathcal{C}_{Cor}>\mathcal{C}_{Clu}  \qquad \rho_{C}(0)=0.1,\\
\mathcal{C}_{Bet}>\mathcal{C}_{Deg}>\mathcal{C}_{Cor}>\mathcal{C}_{Hin}>\mathcal{C}_{Clo}>\mathcal{C}_{Clu}  \qquad \rho_{C}(0)=0.3,\\
\mathcal{C}_{Bet}>\mathcal{C}_{HIn}>\mathcal{C}_{Deg}>\mathcal{C}_{Cor}>\mathcal{C}_{Clo}>\mathcal{C}_{Clu}  \qquad \rho_{C}(0)=0.5.
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{eqnarray*}

Basically, the centralities can be roughly classified into two groups according to their relative sequence
It can be observed that Betweenness, Degree and HIndex can noticeably enhance the resilience of cooperation
compared with other centralities, especially in the case of $\rho_{C}(0)=0.1$(see the first column).
However, all the centrality Betweenness can not keep stable toward the variation of $\rho_{C}(0)$,
depending sensitively on it.
As increasing $\rho_{C}(0)$, the gaps of $\mathcal{C}$ between different centralities reduce,
which attributes to the power law distribution of centrality of vertices(see Fig.\ref{fig corr centrality k=2}).
Another distinctive evolutionary feature in sparse network is the coexist of cooperators and defectors in certain
region of T-S plane, particularly for the centrality closeness(panels d,e,f) and coreness(panels j,k,l)
that cannot yield all-cooperator($\mathcal{C}=1$) on the T-S plane.
    Results for the degree k=2.7 are reported in Fig.\ref{PowerlawK2.7TopRankTSPanel}.
As plots clearly show, the overall level of cooperation in this case considerably outperform that of k=2.0
as well as in the benchmark results.
Similarly, centrality Degree, Betweenness and HIndex still play the role of better promotors
and Closeness, Coreness, Cluster play worse one, but the discrepancy weakens.
In addition, the sensitivity of each centrality toward initial condition also alleviate.
    Fig.\ref{PowerlawK4TopRankTSPanel} corresponds to the case of degree k=4.
The overall $\mathcal{C}$ of each panel is similar as the case of k=2.7,
which is inconsistent with the influence of degree k=2.7(Figs.\ref{powerlawK23TSPanel}j,k,l)
and k=4(Figs.\ref{powerlawK2468TSPanel}d,e,f) in the benchmark result.
Meanwhile, the all-cooperator phase and all-defector phase occupy the T-S plane and the
boundary of their transition become evident.
In the case of k=8 illustrated in Fig.\ref{PowerlawK8TopRankTSPanel},
a similar situation is observed, albeit the cooperation level slightly declines.
    It is noteworthy that with the increase of degree k, the transition boundary between
all-cooperator and all-defector gradually deviate the parallel of diagonal line in the T-S plane.
For example as displayed in Fig.\ref{PowerlawK8TopRankTSPanel}c, the cooperation density
$\rho_{c}(\infty)=1$ when $T<0.45$ regardless of the variation of $S$, accordingly larger than which
cooperators almost vanish.

\subsection{Centrality update strategy} %%%  centrality update strategy

Previous research suggests that absence of network reciprocity is a general feature of
evolutionary dynamics if players do not base their decisions on others’ payoffs,
which is supported  in theoretical xx and experimental xx results.
All the results presented so far have been obtained with a standard Fermi imitator update of strategies, namely the payoff based evolutionary dynamic.
What's the result if we consider non-payoff and payoff-centrality mixed based evolutionary dynamic?
    To simulate these cases, the Fermi imitator probability Eq.(1) is replaced by Centrality-payoff version

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(s_y^t\rightarrow s_x^{t+1})=max\{ \frac{1}{1+e^{-[(P_y^t-P_x^t)]/k}},\frac{1}{1+e^{-[(C^i_y-C^i_x)]/k} }\}
\label{eq_mixedFermi}
\end{equation}
where $C^i_x$ indicates player x's score of centrality $i$.
Here the update rule incorporates the affect of individual centrality by comparing both payoffs
and centralities so that the final probability is stochastically determined by the pairwise ones with higher gap.
    If the term $1+e^{-[(P_y^t-P_x^t)]/k}$ is removed from Eq.\ref{eq_mixedFermi},
the dynamic becomes non-payoff update rule.
Perceptibly, it ought to yield overall full cooperation results in the present simulation.
Because the player's centrality keep invariant, together with the initial cooperators possess higher centrality, the imitation of strategy is unidirectional, which implies that the defectors with lower
centrality definitely replicate the cooperation strategy but not vice versa.
    Therefore, we shift our interesting to the mixed condition.
Intuitively, one might assume introducing centrality into mixed strategy updating will improve the cooperation level as well as in the case of aforementioned non-payoff update,
at least yielding non-worse outcomes.
Rather contrary, as shown in Figs.\ref{PowerlawK2RankUpdate}-\ref{PowerlawK8RankUpdate} it is clear that, compared with traditional Fermi update network reciprocity fails to protect cooperators.
Comparing Fig.\ref{PowerlawK2RankUpdate} and Fig.\ref{PowerlawK2TopRankTSPanel},
for example, represents the dramatic difference between payoff-based and mixed-based updating strategy
on degree k=2 where besides centrality Degree(panels m,n and o in Fig.\ref{PowerlawK2RankUpdate}),
the other cooperation densities drop to almost zero.
    To elucidate this paradox phenomenon, we examine two realizations of simulations based on
payoff update and mixed update separately.
Without loss generality, we choose the parameter values of $k=4,T=2.5,S=0.5,\rho_{C}(0)=0.3$ and centrality Closeness.
    The sharp differences in results is clearly shown in Fig.\ref{payoffUpdateProcess}(payoff update)
and Fig.\ref{centralityUpdateProcess}(mixed update).
    panel (d) plots the frequency of switching between cooperators and defectors of each player,
which presents identical characteristic between payoff and mixed update rules.
The frequency of switching is stronger heterogeneity in Fig.\ref{payoffUpdateProcess}d compared with that in Fig.\ref{centralityUpdateProcess}d.
Although all the players update strategy in the similar frequency in mixed update rules, there are no
update-stable ones.
    Another noticeable difference is the players with higher centralities are more stable, namely seldom change
strategy.

This result, apparently caused by the mixed update drives us to further analyze individual behaviors.
According to the mixed update rule Eq.\ref{eq_mixedFermi}, there are four situations regarding of payoff and centrality when one player x as imitator intends to change strategy:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
(a)\qquad C_x<C_y,P_x<P_y,\\
(b)\qquad C_x>C_y,P_x<P_y,\\
(c)\qquad C_x<C_y,P_x>P_y,\\
(d)\qquad C_x>C_y,P_x>P_y,
\end{aligned}
\right.
\label{eq_mixedupdate_conditions}
\end{eqnarray}
where $C_x$ and $C_y$ indicate the centrality of imitator and imitated player separately.
In the condition (a), the imitator x prefers to update strategy which is deduced by both payoffs
and centralities. Similarly, imitator x retains strategy in condition (b).
 accords with that by centralities , while they are opposite in the conditions (b) and (c).
Accordingly, we calculated the numbers of update behavior determined by payoffs and centralities, and
corresponding numbers of conditions (b) and (c).
Fig.\ref{centralityUpdateProcessDetails} presents this outcome for two patterns of update, Cooperation to Defection(panel (a)) and inverse case(panel (b).

It is observed that most update behaviors arise from payoffs, which perhaps

players with highest centrality obtain larger payoffs hence they have no incentive to change strategy.
However, for majority players with small centralities,

Note that the centrality is normalized to [0,1] but the range of individual payoff exceeds [0,1],
which gives rise to the probability
$1+e^{-[(P_y^t-P_x^t)]/k}$
$1+e^{-[(C^i_y-C^i_x)]/k}$

We also validate the case of normalized payoffs, it doesn't qualitatively affect the result.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work we have investigated the effect of individual importance on the evolution of cooperation.

To this end, we have considered a mechanism for players to update their strategy based on
the mixed comparison of payoff and centrality.


Besides centralities, the degree $k$ and initial fraction of cooperators $\rho_{C}(0)$
also have interconnected striking influence toward evolution outcome.

conclusion is strengthened and quantitatively corroborated
the non-monotonous variation of results across the ST-space

attenuate

Moreover, the impact of centrality correlated aspiration levels has also been studied [101], and it was shown that a positive correlation, such that the larger the degree of a player the higher its aspiration level, promotes cooperation. Together, these results indicate that favouring hubs by either decreasing their investments or increasing their pay-offs or aspiration promotes the evolution of public cooperation, which in turn strengthens the importance of hubs as declared already in the seminal paper by Santoset al.[90]. Social diversity promotes the emergence of cooperation in public goods games.

These results may help us understand questions such as how a network structure influences the evolutionary
process, how to design suitable collaboration networks and stimulate population to promote cooperative behaviors.

To conclude, we must recognize the strong dependence on details of evolutionary games on structured networks.
As a consequence, it does not seem plausible to expect general laws that could be applied in a wide range of practical situations.
On the contrary, a close modeling including the
kind of game, the evolutionary dynamics and the population structure of the concrete problem seems mandatory to reach sound and compelling conclusions.
